        "# *Monster Chase Game*\n",
        "\n",
        "## *Introduction*\n",
        "In this game, the player navigates through a grid, aiming to reach a safe zone while avoiding a monster. The grid is filled with random obstacles that create challenges in finding the optimal path. Both the player and the monster move towards their respective targets using the BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithm, ensuring that the shortest available path is taken.\n",
        "\n",
        "## *Game Features*\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Randomized Grid**:\n",
        "   - The grid layout is randomly generated with unique positions for the player, monster, safe zone, and obstacles in every game. This ensures a fresh challenge each time.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Pathfinding (BFS)**:\n",
        "   - Both the player and the monster use the BFS algorithm to navigate the grid, making strategic decisions to either escape or chase.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Obstacles**:\n",
        "   - Random obstacles are placed throughout the grid, blocking paths and requiring players to find alternate routes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Turn-based Movement**:\n",
        "   - The player and monster take turns. The player aims to reach the safe zone, while the monster follows the player. This adds urgency and excitement as the player tries to evade the monster.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Victory/Defeat Conditions**:\n",
        "   - The player wins if they reach the safe zone before the monster catches them. The game ends in defeat if the monster catches the player first.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Visual Grid Representation**:\n",
        "   - The game visually displays the grid with markers for the player, monster, safe zone, obstacles, and the path taken, allowing players to see the gameplay unfold.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Game Rules\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Objective**:\n",
        "   - The playerâ€™s goal is to reach the safe zone ('Z') on the grid while avoiding capture by the monster ('M').\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Setup**:\n",
        "   - The grid is randomly populated with the player, monster, safe zone, and obstacles ('X').\n",
        "   - The player starts at a random position marked by 'P'.\n",
        "   - The monster starts at a different random position marked by 'M'.\n",
        "   - The safe zone is placed at a position different from both the player and the monster.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Movement**:\n",
        "   - The game proceeds in turns:\n",
        "     - **Player Turn**: The player moves towards the safe zone using the shortest path available.\n",
        "     - **Monster Turn**: The monster moves towards the player using the shortest path available.\n",
        "   - Both the player and monster move one step at a time in one of the four possible directions: up, down, left, or right.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Obstacles**:\n",
        "   - Obstacles ('X') block movement and cannot be passed.\n",
        "   - Neither the player nor the monster can move onto a cell with an obstacle.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Winning and Losing**:\n",
        "   - **Win Condition**: The player wins if they reach the safe zone before being caught by the monster.\n",
        "   - **Lose Condition**: The player loses if the monster catches them (i.e., the player and monster occupy the same cell).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Game End**:\n",
        "   - The game ends when the player either reaches the safe zone or is caught by the monster.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Grid Display**:\n",
        "   - The grid is displayed to show the positions of the player, monster, safe zone, obstacles, and the path taken by the player.\n",
        "\n"
