Task Overview

In this lab task, you will extend the Number Guessing Game by implementing it using 
different search algorithms. You are required to implement the following versions:

1. Non-AI Version: Player vs Computer (already provided).

2. AI Version with Binary Search: Computer vs Player (as already provided).

3. BFS Version: Implement the Number Guessing Game where the AI uses 
Breadth-First Search (BFS) to guess the number.

4. DFS Version: Implement the Number Guessing Game where the AI uses Depth First Search (DFS) to guess the number.

5. Your Own Algorithm: Implement the Number Guessing Game using an 
algorithm of your choice. You can choose from algorithms like Simulated 
Annealing, Genetic Algorithm, or any other search strategy. Explain your choice 
in the code comments
